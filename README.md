We are designing a decentralized marketplace which can be further extended to meet specific requirements. Moreover, we are developing smart contracts of this marketplace to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Also, we are develing a backend to interact with the smart contracts of the marketplace. 

### **Below we describe development tools used.**
For the development of smart contracts for decentralized marketplace, we are using Solidity programming language, which is the most popular contract-oriented language for Ethereum. 

In order to compile, deploy, and test our Solidity smart contracts, we used the Remix IDE to test and deploy contracts. This framework is easy to use, and smart contracts can be compiled and deployed using simple commands. Remix is compatible with live blockchain test networks, which can be used for deployment of smart contracts.

For testing purposes, we used Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain that was created by Truffle developers. The friendly UI of Ganache made it easy for us to observe the process and transactions during testing.
